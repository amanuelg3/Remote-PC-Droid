Remote-PC-Droid
===============

This is an android app that can remotely control the hosting computer using Wi-Fi. The server is located at the remote computer regardless of any platform( Java is used) then the client in the android device tries to connect to the server. Upon succesful completion of connection, the android device can control the mouse function, keyboard function, file browsing option, shutdown option. This is really reasy to use !!
Any comment or suggestions are highly recommended.
